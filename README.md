# book-notes
Little notes from books that I read.

As a personal goal, I try to read at least one book a month, depending on my schedule. Many books have great lessons or points that I want to remember to implement into my personal or professional life, but handwritten notes get out of control. 

So, here they are.

*PS - buy the books, they're pretty rad and you'll get the full experience.*
